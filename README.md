# Signal Processing for Geophysics

This project explores signal processing techniques applied to simulated geophysical signals, including seismic waveforms.

## Notebooks

1. **FFT Analysis** – Fast Fourier Transform on simple signals  
2. **Low-Pass Filtering** – Denoising signals using cutoff frequency  
3. **Multi-Frequency Signal** – Separating components from a mixed signal  
4. **Seismic Wave Simulation** – Modeling seismic waves and echoes

## Tools Used

- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Signal Processing Concepts

## Target Role

Projects are tailored to showcase skills relevant for roles in signal processing, seismic imaging, and physics-based modeling at companies like **Viridien**.
