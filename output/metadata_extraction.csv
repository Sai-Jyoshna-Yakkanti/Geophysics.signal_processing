Thursday,  March 31, 2022, 05:44:01 UTC
A magnitude 7.0 earthquake has occurred 279 km (173 miles) ESE of 
Tadine, New Caledonia at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles). A tsunami warning 
issued for the region has been lifted. There are no immediate reports of 
damage or injuries.

USGS estimated shaking intensity from M 7.0 Earthquake
The Modified-Mercalli Intensity 
(MMI) scale is a ten-stage 
scale, from I to X, that indicates 
the severity of ground shaking. 
Intensity is based on observed 
effects and is variable over the 
area affected by an earthquake. 
Intensity is dependent on 
earthquake size, depth, 
distance, and local conditions.

people felt light shaking from this 
earthquake.

The color-coded contour lines outline regions of MMI intensity.  
The total population exposure to a given MMI value is obtained by 
summing the population between the contour lines. The estimated 
population exposure to each MMI Intensity is shown in the table.

5,"This regional map shows the complexity of major tectonic plates and microplates resulting 
from the convergence between the Australian and Pacific Plates.  The red star indicates the 
epicenter of this earthquake. The location and focal mechanism indicate that this earthquake 
resulted from thrust faulting on or near the boundary between the subducting Australian Plate 
and the overriding Pacific Plate in the subduction zone at the South New Hebrides Trench.

longer IRIS animation that looks 
at seismicity and tectonics of 
Australian – Pacific Plate 
interactions immediately to the 
northwest of this earthquake
The animation examines three 
cross sections from southeast 
to northwest that reveal a 
change from:
1.
Steeply-dipping subduction 
along the New Hebrides 
trench to
2.
Strike-slip motion along the 
Solomon Islands to
3.
Shallow-dipping subduction 
farther to the west.

"
7,"USGS WPhase Centroid Moment Tensor Solution
The focal mechanism is how seismologists plot the 3-D stress orientations of an 
earthquake. Because an earthquake occurs as slip on a fault, it generates 
primary (P) waves in quadrants where the first pulse is compressional (shaded) 
and quadrants where the first pulse is extensional (white). The orientation of 
these quadrants determined from recorded seismic waves identifies the type of 
fault that produced the earthquake.
The earthquake occurred as the result of reverse faulting on or near the plate 
boundary interface between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate.

Remember, this was the focal mechanism 
solution for this earthquake.  It was estimated 
by analysis of the pattern of ""first motions"", 
that is, whether the first-arriving P waves 
push up or pull down.","S

9,"With instrumental noise from early spring weather and the great distance to this magnitude 
7.0 earthquake, picking arrivals of seismic waves on this seismogram is a challenge.  
S
The first seismic waves to arrive from this earthquake were the compressional 
P waves.  Following the earthquake, it took 13 minutes and 6 seconds for the
P waves to travel a curved path through the mantle to Bend, Oregon.
Surface Waves
The record of the earthquake in Bend, Oregon (BNOR) is illustrated below.  
Bend is 10,143 km (6,303 miles, 91.4°) from the location of this earthquake.  
P
S waves are shear waves that follow the same path through the mantle as P waves.  
S waves took 24 minutes and 6 seconds to travel from the earthquake to Bend.
Surface waves traveled the 10,143 km (6,303 miles) along the perimeter 
of the Earth from the earthquake to the recording seismometer.
